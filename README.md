# plainJS_dayCounter

This is a simple chrome extension app developed with JavaScript and HTML, and some basic CSS styling. It's my first attempt to create an webapp.

## Usage

Download the codes and put in a folder

ğŸ‘‰ Go to Chrome browser
ğŸ‘‰ Extensions on the top right corner
ğŸ‘‰ Manage extensions
ğŸ‘‰ Load unpacked
ğŸ‘‰ Select the folder containing the code
ğŸ“Œ Play with it

## How it works

ğŸ“† Storing and accessing event data in local storage
ğŸ’¡ Calculate day difference
ğŸ”¨ Basic browser DOM, html elements and event listeners.

## Thoughts

After I learned and used React js, I encountered more useful JavaScript modules such as https://momentjs.com/.
I am pretty sure there are all sorts of utility libraries out there for people to implement instead of re-inventing the wheel.
